4. Contributing Guidelines
Feature Development Workflow
When contributing new features to Spxing AI, follow these steps:

Create a new branch for your feature:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
Implement your feature or enhancement, ensuring adherence to the code style and conventions.

Write unit tests to validate the functionality of your feature.

Run the tests and ensure they pass without errors:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover
Commit your changes and push the branch to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature
Open a pull request on GitHub, describing the purpose and details of your feature.

Pull Request Guidelines
When submitting a pull request:

Provide a clear and concise description of your changes.
Ensure that all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
Include any relevant documentation updates for your feature.
Code Style and Conventions
Follow these code style and conventions when working on the Spxing AI codebase:

Use PEP 8 guidelines for naming conventions and code formatting.
Write docstrings for classes and functions to provide clear explanations of their purpose and usage.
Add inline comments for complex or non-obvious code sections.
5. Suggested Features and Implementation
Spxing AI supports various advanced features. Here are some suggestions and their possible implementation details:

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Implement advanced NLP techniques like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
Use pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT for improved language understanding.
Neural Network and Self-Learning
