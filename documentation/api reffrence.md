6. Examples
Speech-to-Text Conversion

import requests

audio_data = # Provide audio data

response = requests.post("https://api.spxing.ai/speech-to-text/convert", json={"audio_data": audio_data})

if response.status_code == 200:
    converted_text = response.json()
    print(converted_text)
Text-to-Speech Conversion

import requests

text = # Provide text to be converted

response = requests.post("https://api.spxing.ai/text-to-speech/convert", json={"text": text})

if response.status_code == 200:
    audio_file = response.content
    # Save or play the audio file
Task Automation

import requests

command = # Provide the task command

response = requests.post("https://api.spxing.ai/task-automation/perform", json={"command": command})

if response.status_code == 200:
    result = response.json()
    print(result)
Knowledge Base Queri

import requests

query = # Provide the query string

response = requests.get("https://api.spxing.ai/knowledge-base/query", params={"query": query})

if response.status_code == 200:
    information = response.json()
    print(information)
Language Processing

import requests

text = # Provide the text to be processed

response = requests.post("https://api.spxing.ai/language-processing/process", json={"text": text})

if response.status_code == 200:
    processed_info = response.json()
    print(processed_info)
7. Best Practices
Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the Spxing AI API implements rate limiting. Take care to manage your API requests within the specified limits.

Error Handling and Resilience
Handle API errors gracefully by examining the response status code and error messages. Implement appropriate retry mechanisms and fallback strategies to handle temporary failures.

Security Considerations
When integrating with the Spxing AI API, ensure secure transmission of data over HTTPS. Safeguard your API keys or access tokens and follow security best practices to protect user data.
